While the arcade games are games develop skills, slot machines have been become the machine paradigm that encourages gambling with economic reward. The fundamental difference between the old machines of the million or of Martian sand the lot machine.
I recommend this:
- think that the player gets in the latter is economic. In these cases, when it comes to a pathological player, the playful component from to play is lost by the degree of anxiety and / or compulsion of the activity itself. The tragaperras are available to the player in bars and casinos and, as his name indicates, the bet is small. Therefore, the player has the
feeling of control, that your choices increase the possibility of winning and that does not depend exclusively on luck as
It happens in roulette. None of this is true: the actions of the subject  are determined by an intermittent reinforcement program and not because of his ability. Today there is also the possibility of playing this type of games online
 interactively (for example roulette on-line), what which multiplies the number of potential pathological players.
The mechanisms of addiction
It should be noted that psychologically the game of chance is a challenge to the luck, through which a person tries to test their fantasy. You must magically change your destiny. The magical aspect of the game
It's essential. Called games of chance because there is no way to systematically check the results of the game and, therefore, hardly the skills of the person intervene.
To distinguish the games is the type of reward that is obtained when playing.
So much so that in English a distinction is made between
gambling(play games in those who risk something to make a profit) and playing (play those in which only entertainment is pursued).
From a neurological point of view, an electrical stimulation of some regions of the brain produce a clear reinforcing effect. 
Although at present both supports allow the modality online, if you compared to the MMORPG, this is done with a much smaller number of game partners and very limited interactivity.
When playing becomes a problem: the pathological game and the addiction to role-playing online 206 dopaminergic ronas whose cellular bodies are located in the mesencephalo. These cells send their axons to some areas of the system limbic and cerebral cortex. Normally the circuits of recombrain thinking are stimulated by behaviors that have a Survival value: eat food, drink water, maintain a adequate body temperature, sexual activity or intervention social and family However, these reward areas can
be stimulated by other behaviors or by substances; such is the case of some drugs, such as cocaine or nicotine, which can stimulate powerfully and directly these circuits (Rosenzweig and Leiman, 1992).
The slot player receives a response to his action, knows if his. Play has been winning or losing, every five seconds. It is an acti-repetitive, self-stimulative.
When learning psychologists analyze a behavior they are set in the reinforcement program and the characteristics of the reinforces dores (Domjan, 2004; Tarpy, 1999). The game of chance is clearly a case of what is calledprogram of intermittent reinforcement, not all the behaviors are reinforced and not always. The machines are designed to reward each determined number of moves, independently of the type of action carried out, because it is known that the intermittent training is the most powerful mechanism to maintain established behavior, in this case the play for money.
Regarding the intensity or power of the reinforcer we know that the money is a powerful reinforcer and its absence a powerful
reinforcer negative (in principle, the decrease or lack of reward economics would reduce the occurrence of the behavior of playing). The duck player logical, to recover the lost money, is engaged in a spiral increasingly damaging, because he knows he could ever win (positive intermittent reinforcement).
Another minor factor is that the primary reinforcer (the money) is preceded by conditioned stimuli that precede it.
Just as Pavlov's dog learned that the bell on the door preceded the meal, the player learns that certain music or sounds are linked to the machine.Play friv unblocked games online at school in the browser.
